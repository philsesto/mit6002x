## 2.7 Stochastic Processes

In the typical introduction to programming, programs are treated as functions -- given a set of inputs, each function produces a specific output.  
Now, we're about to dive into the murky waters of uncertainty.  We'll be writing programs whose output can't necessarily be predicted based on the inputs.  

- "We can't really write programs that model the world without confronting uncertainty."
- "Uncertainty is uncomfortable, but certainty is usually not justified."

---
### Stochastic Processes
---

- an ongoing process where the next state might depend on both the previous states **and some random element**

```python
def rollDie():
"""
    returns an int between 1 and 6
"""

def rollDie():
    """
        returns a randomly chosen int between 1 and 6
    """
```
- these are two **fundamentally different specifications**
- the first spec is undetermined
    - we don't know what it returns
- the second spec *requires **randomness*** and is therefore the example of the stochastic process

---
### Specifications And Implementations
---

```python
def squareRoot(x, epsilon):
    """
        Assumes x and epsilon are of type float
            x >= 0 and epsilon > 0
        Returns float y such that x-epsilon <= y*y <= x+epsilon
    """
```
- `squareRoot` finds an approximation within `epsilon` of the square root of `x`
- this spec *allows*, but does not *require* a non-deterministic implementation
- the thing to keep in mind about non-deterministic programs is that they can be really tricky when debugging programs that call them
    - sometimes you might get an answer that works, sometimes not
        - we'll delve deeper into this

---
### Implementing A Random Process
---

```python
import random

def rollDie():
    """
        Returns a random int between 1 and 6
    """
    return random.choice([1,2,3,4,5,6])

def testRoll(n=10):
    result = ''
    for i in range(n):
        result = result + str(rollDie())
    print(result)
```
- `random` is, of course, a standard Python library containing function that are extremely useful for implementing stochastic processes
- `choice` gives *equal* probability for the provided args (in list)

---

## 2.8 Probabilities

---
### Probability Of Various Results
---

- consider `testRoll(5)`
    - which of the following outputs would surprise you?
        - `11111`
        - `54424`
    - what is the probability of each?

---
### Probability Is About Counting
---

- count the number of possible events
- count the number of events that have the property of interest
- divide one by the other

- probability of `11111`?
    - the sequence of all possible events is `6^5`
    - of all the possible events, there's one element in that sequence that has five `1`s in it, so:
       - `1/6^5`
- probability of `54424`?
    - exactly the same

---
### Three Basic Facts About Probability
---

- probabilities are always in the range **0 to 1**
    - **0** if **impossible**
    - **1** if **guaranteed**
- if the probability of an event occurring is `p`, the probability of it not occurring must be `1-p`
- when events are **independent** of each other, the probability of all the events occurring is equal to a **product** of the probabilities of each of the events occurring
    - in probability, independent is an enormously important concept

---
### Independence
---

- two events are **independent** if the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other

- when events are independent, it is usually reasonably easy to reason about a sequence of events
- when things are not independent, things can get more complex very quickly 
- consequently, assuming things are independent when they're not can lead one seriously astray

---
### El Clasico: Real Vs. Barca
---

- both good teams
- assume both are playing the same day
- assume each wins, on average, 7 out of 8 games
    - probability of both winning is *7/8 * 7/8 = 49/64*
    - probability of at least one losing, then, is *1 - 49/64 = 15/64*
        - this calculation is valid under the assumption that the probability of one team winning or losing is independent of the probability of the other team winning or losing
- but suppose they're playing each other?
    - the outcomes are no longer independent
    - probability of one team losing is obviously higher that *15/64*!

---
### A Simulation
---

```python
import random
random.seed(0)

def rollDie():
    """
        Returns a random int between 1 and 6
    """
    return random.choice([1,2,3,4,5,6])

def testRoll(n=10):
    result = ''
    for i in range(n):
        result = result + str(rollDie())
    print(result)

def runSim(goal, numTrials):
    total = 0
    for i in range(numTrials):
        result = ''
        for j in range(len(goal)):
            result = result + str(rollDie())
        if result == goal:
            total = total + 1
    print('Actual probability =', round(1/(6**len(goal)), 8))
    
    estProbability = rount(total/numTrials, 8)
    print('Estimated probability =', round(estProbability, 8))

runSim('11111', 1000)

# OUTPUTS:
# Actual Probability: 0.0001286
# Estimated Probability: 0.0
# Actual Probability: 0.0001286
# Estimated Probability: 0.0
```
- this is actually not stochastic because of the call to `random.seed(0)`
    - `random` actually generates **pseudorandom** numbers, which work typically, by reading some unexpected value, 
        - from that seed we can generate a sequence of results
        - given a seed, always get the same sequence, but the seed is **predictably non-deterministic**
            - i.e., we don't know what the seed will be
                - still, we can cheat, and that's what we've done here by providing `0` as seed
                - since we use the same seed every time we run this program, we get the same answer
                    - this is incredibly useful in **degbugging**
                    - this isn't how you want the program to work, ultimately, however, because maybe it only works with some particular choice of seed
- so why did the simulation give us the wrong answer twice, then?
    - the probability is, of course, less than one in a thousand, so it's hardly surprising that we get a sample probability of 0
    - we need to do **more trials**: `runSim('11111', 1000000)`, for example, outputs `0.0001286` for actual probability and estimated probability
        - lesson here is if you only a small number of trials, and you're looking at a very rare event, then you're likely to get the wrong answer out
            - later on, we'll spend a lot of time asking the question, "how many trials do we really need?"

---
### How Common Are Boxcars?
---

- *6^2* possible combinations of two die
    - of those, only 1 has two 6s in it
    - probability of boxcars is then *1/36*
- just for fun, another way of computing it
    - probability of rolling a 6 with one die is *1/6*
    - probability of rolling a 6 with the othe die is also *1/6*
    - since these events are **independent**, probability of rolling a 6 with both die = *1/6 * 1/6* = *1/36* = about *0.2778*

---
### Approximating Using A Simulation
---

```python
def fracBoxCars(numTests):
    numBoxCars = 0
    for i range(numTests):
        if rollDie() == 6 and rollDie() ==6:
            numBoxCars = numBoxCars + 1
    return numBoxCars / numTests

print('Frequency of double 6 =', str(fracBoxCars(100000)*100) + '%')

# OUTPUTS:
# Frequency of double 6 = 2.782%
```
- output is pretty close to what we had calculated using probability theory
- so what are the morals?

---
### Morals
---

1. It takes a lot of trials to get a good estimate of the frequency of occurrence of a rare event
    - we'll talk a lot more about how to **know** when we have enough trials
2. One should not confuse the **sample probability** with the actual probability
3. There was really no need to do this by simulation, since there is a perfectly good closed form answer
    - we will see many examples where this is not true
    - simulations **are** often useful, as we will see

---

## 2.9 Random Walks

---
### Simulation Models
---

- a description of a set of computations that provide useful info about the possible behaviors of the system being modeled
    - typically *most* useful when there is more than one possible behavior, though that's not the only situation in which simulations are useful
- simulation models are **descriptive** not **prescriptive**
    - they're used to tell us what *might happen*, but they don't tell us how to make something happen
    - this is in direct contrast to **optimization** which, as we've seen, provides a prescription for reaching some goal
- a simulation is only an **approximation** to reality
    - "All models are wrong, but some are useful." -- George Box

---
### Simulations Are Used A Lot
---

- to model systems that are mathematically intractable
    - i.e., we can't write a simple set of equations and solve them
        - for example, to predict the future climate of earth, we simulate a bunch of interactions of things that we believe are the most important drivers of the climate
- to extract useful intermediate results
- lend themselves to development by successive refinement and "what if" questioning
- we'll start by simulating random walks

---
### Why Random Walks?
---

- random walks are important in many domains
    - understanding the stock market
    - modeling diffusion processes
    - etc.

---
### Drunkard's Walk
---

- place the drunkard in the center of a grid
- every second, the drunkard takes a step in some random direction (random because he's had so much beer, he has no idea what's going on)
- if he takes 1000 steps, what is the expected distance from origin?
    - if he takes many steps, is he more likely to move ever further from the origin?
    - or since he's moving at random, is he likely to just wander back and forth and get to origin over and over, maybe ending up not too far from it?

- let's do a small simulation as an exercise before looking at some code
- to start, we'll simplify things:
    - assume that every step the drunkard takes is of length 1 *and* is parallel to either the x-axis or y-axis
    - what's distance from origin after one step?
        - it's 1, right?
    - how about two steps from origin?
        - visualizing that you have four different directions from current location, you'll end up back at origin, 2 steps away, or `sqrt(2)` steps away
        - so what's the expected distance from origin after two steps?
            - we can write this out as a formula:
                - `(0.25*0) + (0.25*2) + (0.5*sqrt(2))`
        - roughly 1.2 steps away, but this doesn't tell us much about the case with 3 steps let alone 100000

---
### Expected Distance After 100,000 Steps?
---

- need a different approach to the problem
- will use a simulation
