# Unit 1: Optimization, Dynamic Programming, And Graphs

# Lecture 3: Graph Problems

## 1.6 Graphs

This class is about using computation to model and solve real-world, practical problems.  
One of the most useful tools we have for doing this is called **graph theory**.  

In the last lecture, for example, we saw how to map the problem of choosing what to eat into a careful description of an optimization problem.  We then saw how we could design an efficient program to solve that problem.  

Modeling the knapsack problem was relatively easy, though, because we didn't have to capture any relationships among the items.  
- didn't have to ask how our hamburgers related to apples or beer to hamburgers

---
### What Is A Graph?
---

- set of **nodes** (vertices)
    - might have properties associated with them
- set of **edges** (arcs) each consisting of a pair of nodes
    - **undirected** (graph)
    - **directed** (digraph)
        - **source** (parent) and **destination** (child) nodes
    - **unweighted** or **weighted**

---
### Why Graphs?
---

- to capture useful relationship between entities
    - rail links between Paris and London
    - how atoms in a molecule are related to each other
    - ancestral relationships

---
### Trees, An Important Special Case
---

- a directed graph in which each pair of nodes is connected by a single path
    - recall search trees we used to solve knapsack problem

---
### Why Are Graphs So Useful?
---

- the world is full of networks based on relationships
    - computer networks
    - transportation networks
    - financial networks
    - sewer networks
    - political networks
    - criminal networks
    - social networks
    - etc.

---
### Practial Example: Getting Professor Guttag To The Office
---

- model a road system using a digraph
    - nodes: points where roads end or meet
    - edges: connections between points
        - each edge has a weight indicating time it will take to get from source node to destination node for that edge
- solve a graph optimization problem
    - shorted weighted path between my house and my office

---
### First Reported Use Of Graph Theory
---

- wasn't MapQuest or Google
- Leonhard Euler in 1735
    - Bridges of Konisberg (then the capital of East Prussia)
    - possible to take a walk that traverses each of the 7 bridges exactly once?

Konisberg was built at the intersection of two rivers than contained a number of islands.  The islands were connected to each other and the mainland via seven bridges.  
Reputedly, the residents of the city were obsessed with the question of whether it was possible to take a walk that crossed all 7 bridges exactly once.  
- Euler's great insight was that we didn't need a complicated map to understand the problem -- it could be vastly simplified with a graph

---
### Euler's Model
---

- each island a node
- each bridge an undirected edge
- the ***model abstracts away irrelevant details***
    - size of islands
    - length of bridges
    - capacity of bridges
    - etc.
- so what *is* the problem?
    - is there a path that contains each edge exactly once?
        - Euler observed that, for any such path, each node except the first and last must have an even number of edges
            - no node in the graph representing the city had an even number of edges, and therefore no such walk existed
- the bridge problem is as irrelevant as they come, but in solving it, Euler invented a new way to think about a large class of problems

---

## 1.7 Graph Class

```python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        """
            Assumes name is a string
        """
        self.name = name
    def getName(self):
        return self.name
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
- why not just use a string as a node?
    - leave open the possibility of someday creating a more complex class with the code

```python
class Edge(object):
    def __init__(self, src, dest):
        """
            Assumes src and dest are nodes
        """
        self.src = src
        self.dest = dest
    def getSource(self):
        return self.src
    def getDestination(self):
        return self.dest
    def __str__(self):
        return self.src.getName() + '->' + self.dest.getName()
```
- key design here was to allow for the possibility of edges having directions or creating digraphs with directed edges, even:

---
### Common Representations Of Graphs
---

> If a graph is dense, i.e. lots of nodes, it's often convenient to use something called an adjacency matrix  

- **adjacency matrix**
rows
: source nodes  
columns
: destination nodes  

- cell[`s`,`d`] = 1 if there is an edge from `s` to `d`, 0 otherwise
- if the edges have weights, these values can be as the values of the cells
- in fact, if there's more than one edge between nodes, the cells can be lists

- **adjacency list**
    - associate with each node a list of destination nodes

---
### Class Digraph, Part 1 (Adjacency List Implementation)
---

```python
class Digraph(object):
    """
        edges is a dict mapping each node to a list of its children
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = {}

    def addNode(self, node):
        if node in self.edges:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate node')
        else:
            self.edges[node] = []
    
    def addEdge(self, edge):
        src = edge.getSource()
        dest = edge.getDestination()
        if not (src in self.edges and dest in self.edges):
            raise ValueError('Node not in graph')
        self.edges[src].append(dest)
```
- most of the code here is actually error-checking
    - you might think this is bad, but it's actually not unusual
        - in production code, there's often *as* much code to check for errors as there is to deal with the non-error cases

---
### Class Digraph, Part 2 (Full)
---

```python
class Digraph(object):
    """
        edges is a dict mapping each node to a list of its children
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = {}

    def addNode(self, node):
        if node in self.edges:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate node')
        else:
            self.edges[node] = []
    
    def addEdge(self, edge):
        src = edge.getSource()
        dest = self.getDestination()

        if not (src in self.edges and dest in self.edges):
            raise ValueError('Node not in graph')
        self.edges[src].append(dest)

    def childrenOf(self, node):
        return self.edges[node]

    def hasNode(self, node):
        return node in self.edges

    def getNode(self, name):
        for n in self.edges:
            if n.getName() == name:
                return n
        raise NameError(name)

    def __str__(self):
        result = ''
        for src in self.edges:
            for dest in self.edges[src]:
                result = result + src.getName() + '->' + dest.getName() + '\n'

        # omit the final newline
        return result[:-1]
```

---
### Class Graph
---

Having implemented `class Digraph`, implementing `class Graph` is pretty trivial  

```python
class Graph(Digraph):
    def addEdge(self, edge):
        Digraph.addEdge(self, edge)
        rev = Edge(edge.getDestination(), edge.getSource())
        Digraph.addEdge(self, rev)
```
- we're simply overring `addEdge` from `class Digraph`, using `Digraph.addEdge` to add *two* edges, one in each direction
    - not necessarily the most space-efficient implementation, but the simpilicity is nice  

- but why is `Graph` a subclass of `Digraph`, and not the other way around?
    - remember substitution rule from 6001?
        - if client code works correctly using an instance of the supertype, it should also work correctly when an instance of the subtype is substituted for the instance of the supertype
    - any program that works with a `Digraph` will also work with a `Graph` (but not *vice versa*)

---
### A Classic Graph Optimization Problem
---

- shortest path from *n1* to *n2*
    - shortest sequence of edges such that:
        - source node of first edge is *n1*
        - destination of last edge is *n2*
        - for edges, *e1* and *e2*, in the sequence, if *e2* follows *e1* in the sequence, the source of *e2* is the destination of *e1*
- shortest weighted path
    - mimimize the sum of the weights of the edges in the path

---
### Some Shortest Path Problems
---

- they're all over the place!
    - finding a route from one city to another
    - designing communication networks
    - finding a path for a molecule through a chemical labyrinth
    - the internet doing its thing all the time

- the presence of **cycles** or the possible presence of cycles in graphs complicates solving the shortest path problem
    - you might recall that this was not an issue with search trees, as trees don't have cycles

---
### Build Example Graph
---

```python
def buildCityGraph():
    g = Digraph()
    for name in ('Boston', 'Providence', 'New York', 'Chicago', 'Denver', 'Phoenix', 'Los Angeles'):
        # Create 7 nodes
        g.addNode(Node(name))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Boston'), g.getNode('Providence')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Boston'), g.getNode('New York')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Providence'), g.getNode('Boston')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Providence'), g.getNode('New York')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('New York'), g.getNode('Chicago')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Chicago'), g.getNode('Denver')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Denver'), g.getNode('Phoenix')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Denver'), g.getNode('New York')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Chicago'), g.getNode('Phoenix')))
    g.addEdge(Edge(g.getNode('Los Angeles'), g.getNode('Boston')))
    return g
```
- notice that we gave this function an argument of the type `Graph`
    - why did we do that?
        - now, when we build it, we can build a digraph *or* a graph
            - `buildCityGraph(Digaph)` or `buildCityGraph(Graph)`

## 1.8 Finding The Shortest Path

---
### Depth-First Search
---

- similar to left-first, depth-first method of enumerating a search tree (Lecture 2)
- main difference is that graph may have cycles, so we must keep track of what nodes we have visited

```python
def DFS(graph, start, end, path, shortest):
    path = path + [start]
    if start == end:
        return path
    
    for node in graph.childrenOf(start):
        # avoid cycles
        if node not in path:
            if shortest == None or len(path) < len(shortest):
                newPath = DFS(graph, node, end, path, shortest, toPrint)

                if newPath != None:
                    shortest = newPath
    return shortest

def shortestPath(graph, start, end):
    return DFS(graph, start, end, [], None)
```
- we call `DFS` from a wrapper function: `shortestPath`
    - takes two fewer args than `DFS`
        - that makes sense, as the args `path` and `shortest` are artifacts of the algorithm
            -   `path` is used to keep track of where we are in the graph while `shortest` is used to keep track of the best solution found so far
    - gets recursion started properly (initializes `path` to empty list, `shortest` to `None`)
    - provides appropriate abstraction

---
### Breadth-First Search
---

```python
def BFS(graph, start, end, toPrint=False):
    initPath = [start]
    pathQueue = [initPath]

    if toPrint:
        print('Current BFS path:', printPath(pathQueue))
    while len(pathQueue) != 0:

        # get and remove oldest element in pathQueue
        tmpPath = pathQueue.pop(0)
        print('Current BFS path:', printPath(tmpPath))
        lastNode = tmpPath[-1]

        if lastNode == end:
            return tmpPath
        for nextNode in graph.childrenOf(lastNode):
            if nextNode not in tmpPath:
                newPath = tmpPath + [nextNode]
                pathQueue.append(newPath)
    return None
```
- code here is more complicated as we're exploring many paths in parallel, not one at a time
- `pathQueue` stores all the paths currently being explored
- each iteration starts by removing a path from the `pathQueue` and assigning that path to `tmpPath`
    - if the last node in `tmpPath` is `end`, `tmpPath` is the shortest path and is returned
    - otherwise, a set of new paths is created, each of which extends `tmpPath` by adding one of its children
    - each of these new paths is added to the `pathQueue`
- as soon as we find a solution, we return it
    - why does this work?
        - it's because of the way BFS works -- it explores all paths with *n* hops before exploring any path with more than *n* hops
        - since it's exploring the paths in length order, we know that the first path found is shortest

---
### What About A Weighted Shortest Path?
---

- want to minimize the sum of the weights of the edges, not the number of edges
    - DFS can be easily modified to handle this while BFS cannot
        - shortest weighted path may have more than the minimum number of hops

---
### Recap
---

- graphs are cool
    - best way to capture a model of many things
        - capture relationships among objects
    - many important problems can be posed as graph optimization problems that we already know how to solve
- DFS and BFS are important algorithms
    - can be used to solve many problems
