# Unit 1: Optimization, Dynamic Programming, And Graphs

# Lecture 1: Optimization And The Knapsack Problem

## Intro
- the programming assignments in this course might be easier than those in 6001
    - but you might also find that, while you struggle less with code, you might struggle more with understanding the concepts you're trying to implement
- the focus of this course is indeed to focus more on the problem to be solved rather than the programming of the solution
    - for this reason, the lecures are more abstract
- we'll talk about computation in a general way
    - how do we use computation to do something that we truly care about?

- practice makes perfect
- what will we be practicing on?
    - building computational models
        - computational model is a device that helps us use computation to help understand the world in which we live
        - think about it as an experimental device
            - the device can help us understand something that's already happened, or, often more usefully, to predict something that might happen in the future
- what kind of experimental devices are there?
    - optimization models
    - statistical models
    - simulation models
- mostly, we'll look at models that involve **uncertainty**, though that's not where we'll start

## 1.1 Knapsack Problem

The notion of an **optimization problem** provides a structured way to think about solving lots of computational problems.  

Whenever you set about solving a problem that involves finding the biggest, smallest, most, fewest, fastest, least expensive, etc., there's a good chance that you can map that problem onto a classic optimization problem for which there is a known computational solution.  

---
### What Is An Optimization Model?
---

- what does a classic optimization problem look like?
    - there are two parts:
        - objective function
            - to be maximized or minimized
                - e.g., minimize time spend traveling from New York to Boston
        - set of constraints (possibly empty) 
            - these must be honored
                - e.g., cannot spend more than $100, must be in Boston *before* 5:00pm

- **many** problems of **real importance** can be formulated as an optimization problem
- reducing a seemingly new problem to an instance of a well-known problem allows one to use pre-existing methods for solving them
- solving optimization problems is compuationally challenging
    - this in a computational complexity sense -- they can run for a really long time
        - because of this, we don't actually solve them, we approximate them and use a greedy algorithm to find not an optimal solution, but a solution that is good enough
- a greedy algorithm is often a practical approach to finding a pretty good **approximate** solution to an optimization problem

---
### Knapsack And Bin-Packing Problems
---

- basic idea:
    - you've got a knapsack
    - knapsack has a finite capacity *and* you have more objects you'd like to put in than will actually fit in
    - must decide which objects to take and which to leave behind
    - there's a maximum weight you can carry

- an example:
    - overweight person decides to go on diet, needs to optimize an objective function related to their tastebuds, the most possible pleasure you can get by eating while satisfying a 1,500 calorie per day constraint

- there are two variants of a knapsack problem
    - **0/1 knapsack problem**
        - if you're stealing a Picasso, there **isn't** much point in stealing half the painting
            - either take the whole thing, or none of it
    - **continuous** or **fractional knapsack problem**
        - dieter doesn't have to eat all those calories at once

- good way to think about this is going back to our knapsack and gold:
    - if you wanted to bring as much gold in your pack as possible, there are two ways to look at it:
        - gold dust: just fill to maximum volume and weight
        - gold bars: generally no way to split a bar -- in fact, you want to maintain that integrity

---
### 0/1 Knapsack Problem, Formalized
---

- each item is represented by a pair `<value, weight>`
- knapsack can accomodate items with a total weight of no more than `w`
    - and, of course, instead of wieght here, we could be talking about calories, credits for a course, miles you're driving, time, anything...
- a vector, `L`, of length, `n`, represents the set of available items
    - each element of the vector is an item
- a vector `V`, of length `n`, is used to indicate whether or not items are taken
    - if `V[i] = 1`, item `L[i]` is taken
    - if `V[i] = 0`, item `L[i]` is not taken

---
### Brute Force Algorithm
---

1. enumerate all possible combinations of items
    - i.e., generate all subsets of the set of objects
        - this is called the **power set**
2. remove all combinations whose total units exceeds the allowed weight
3. from the remaining combinations, choose any one whose value is the largest
    - there might be, and often is, more than one optimal solution

---
### Often Not Practical
--- 

- how big is power set?
- recall:
    - a vector, `V`, of length `n` is used to indicate whether or not items are taken
        - if `V[i] = 1`, item `L[i]` is taken
        - if `V[i] = 0`, item `L[i]` is not taken
    - the set of possible vectors represents the set of possible choices of items
        - the vector that's all 0 says we didn't take any
        - the vector that's all 1 says we took them all
        - every other possibility is represented by some sequence of 0s and 1s
    - how many possible different values can `V` have?
        - as many different binary numbers can be represented in `n` bits
    - how many different numbers can we represent in `n` bits?  in 2^`n` numbers?
        - right away, we know the power set is very large, as it's of size 2^`n`
        - the algorithm is exponential, then

---
### Are We Just Being Stupid?
---

- alas, no
    - 0/1 knapsack problem is **inherently exponential**
        - but don't despair
            - there are good ways to find approximate solutions, and there are even ways to make truly optimal solutions to knapsack problems that work almost all the time

---

## 1.2 Greedy Algorithms

The last segment ended with an explanation of why an obviously correct solution to the 0/1 knapsack problem was computationally intractable.  We didn't prove it, but the problem is inherently exponential.  There does not exist a solution that is guaranteed to run in better than exponential time.  

---
### Greedy Algorithm A Practical Alternative
---

```python
while knapsack not full
    put "best" available item in knapsack
```
- but what does it mean to put in the best item?
    - most valuable
    - least expensive
    - highest value/units

---
### An Example
---

- you are about to sit down to a meal
- you know how much you value different foods; e.g., you like donuts more than apples
- but you have a calorie budget; e.g., you don't want to consume more than 800 calories
- choosing what to eat is a knapsack problem

---
### A Menu
---

| Food | wine | beer | pizza | burger | fries | coke | apple | donut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Value | 89 | 90 | 30 | 50 | 90 | 79 | 90 | 10 |
| Calories | 123 | 154 | 258 | 354 | 365 | 150 | 95 | 195 |

- let's look at a program that we can use to decide what to order

---
### Class Food
---

```python
class Food(object):
    def __init__(self, n, v, w):
        self.name = n
        self.value = v
        self.calories = w

    def getValue(self):
        return self.value
    
    def getCost(self):
        return self.calories
    
    def density(self):
        return self.getValue() / self.getCost()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name + ': <' + str(self.value) + ', ' + str(self.calories) + '>'
```

---
### Building Menu Of Foods
---

```python
def buildMenu(names, values, calories):
"""
names, values, calories lists of same length
names a list of strings
values and calories lists of numbers
returns list of Foods
"""
menu = []
for i in range(len(values)):
    menu.append(Food(names[i], values[i], calories[i]))

return menu
```

---
### Implementation Of Flexible Greedy
---

```python
def greedy(items, maxCost, keyFunction):
    """
    assumes items a list, maxCost >= 0, keyFunction maps elements of items to numbers
    """
    itemsCopy = sorted(items, key=keyFunction, reverse=True)

    result = []
    totalValue, totalCost = 0.0, 0.0

    for i in range(len(itemsCopy)):
        if (totalCost + itemsCopy[i].getCost()) <= maxCost:
            result.append(itemsCopy[i])
            totalCost += itemsCopy[i].getCost()
            totalValue += itemsCopy[i].getValue()
    
    return (result, totalValue)
```
- what makes it flexible?
    - this parameter called a key function
    - makes our implementation independent of the defintion of best
        - all that's required is that key function defines an ordering of the elements and items
        - we can then use this ordering to define what we mean by best
            - we do that when we make the call to `sorted()`
                - also notice how we use `sorted`, which returns a list, rather than `sort`, which sorts the list in place
                - we don't to modify the parameter, so we use the former to work with a copy
    - use the key function to decide which elements are bigger or smaller than which other elements
    - once we do that, all we have to do is iterate over the list
        - because we're iterating in order from best to worst, all we have to do is keep checking
        - i.e., if we have room to put the next item in the list into the knapsack, we do it
        - continue until we run out of room
    - since we're only looking at the next best available option at each point, we know that we've made the best possible choices given our greedy ordering

- recall that we resorted to using a greedy algorithm in the first place, which might or might not yield a truly optimal result, because we were concerned about runtime efficiency
    - so let's see if this algorithm actually addresses the issue of exponential complexity
    
---
### Algorithmic Efficiency
---

How much time will our greedy algorithm use?  
- sorting can be done in `n log(n)`, and roughly is in Python
    - this is our lower bound
- then we iterate over the list, which is *O(`n`)*
- so, `n` + `n log(n)`, which is *O(`n log(n)`)*
    - we've improved on efficiency

---
### Using Greedy
---

```python
def testGreedy(items, contraint, keyFunction):
    taken, val = greedy(items, contraint, keyFunction)
    print('Total value of items taken =', val)

    for item in taken:
        print('    ', item)
```

```python
def testGreedys(maxUnits):
    print('Use greedy by value to allocate', maxUnits, 'calories)
    testGreedy(foods, maxUnits, Food.getValue)

    print('\nUse greedy by cost to allocate', maxUnits, 'calories')
    testGreedy(foods, maxUnits, lambda x: 1/Food.getCost(x))

    print('\nUse greedy by density to allocate', maxUnits, 'calories')
    testGreedy(foods, maxUnits, Food.density)

testGreedys(800)
```
- lambda used to create anonymous functions
    - `lambda <id1, id2, ... idn>: <expression>`
    - returns a function of `n` arguments
- possible to write amazing complicated lambda expressions, but you probably shouldn't
    - if it's more than just a line, it's probably too big, and you should think about just using `def` to name the function

- we use the lambda function where we do so that we're ordering from least expensive to most expensive, i.e. doing the inverse of `getCost`

```python
def testGreedys(foods, maxUnits):
    print('Use greedy by value to allocate', maxUnits, 'calories)
    testGreedy(foods, maxUnits, Food.getValue)

    print('\nUse greedy by cost to allocate', maxUnits, 'calories')
    testGreedy(foods, maxUnits, lambda x: 1/Food.getCost(x))

    print('\nUse greedy by density to allocate', maxUnits, 'calories')
    testGreedy(foods, maxUnits, Food.density)

names = ['wine', 'beer', 'pizza', 'burger', 'fries', 'cola', 'apple', 'donut', 'cake']
values = [89, 90, 95, 100, 90, 79, 50, 10]
calories = [123, 154, 258, 354, 365, 150, 95, 195]

foods = buildMenu(names, values, calories)

testGreedys(foods, 750)
```

### Why Different Answers?
---

- sequence of locally "optimal" choices don't always yield a globally optimal solution
    - instead, you might just bounce around local optimums
- that's what a greedy algorithm does:
    - it finds an optimum, but it might not necessarily be the best

- for our example, is greedy by density always a winner?
    - try `testGreedys(foods, 1000)`
    - not as good in this case as greedy by value
    - so, again, there's just no good way to tell

---
### The Pros And Cons Of Greedy
---

- easy to implement
- computationally efficient

- does not always yield optimal solution
    - don't even know how good the approximation is
