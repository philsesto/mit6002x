## 2.10 Location, Field, And Drunk

---
### How Far Will A Drunkard Get?
---

- last lecture we simulated, by hand, a (very short) walk
- but the process we outlined was too labor intensive to be practical for more than a few steps
- but we can write a program to simulate lots of steps

---
### Structure Of Simulation
---
- set of functions:
    - function to simulate ***one* trial**:
        - simulate one walk of `k` steps
    - function to run ***multiple* trials**:
        - simulate `n` such walks
    - function to prepare **report(s) and/or plot(s)** based on the accumulated results:
        - report average distance from origin

- before we get to that. . .

---
### First, Some Useful Abstractions
---

- Location -- a place
- Field -- a collection of places and drunks
- Drunk -- somebody who wanders from place to place in a field

---
### Class Location, Part 1
---

```python
class Location(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        """
        x and y are floats
        """
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def move(self, deltaX, deltaY):
        """
        deltaX and deltaY are floats
        """
        return Location(self.x + deltaX, self.y + deltaY)

    def getX(self):
        return self.x

    def getY(self):
        return self.y
```
- earlier, in the hand simulation, we assumed that we could only move the drunk up, down, left, or right (parallel to either `x`-axis or `y`-axis)
    - therefore, all locations were just described by a pair of integers
    - here, at least for the moment, we're allowing `deltaX` and `deltaY` -- how far we move them horizontally and vertically -- to be floats
        - this gives us a richer notion of location
- another design decision captured here is that locations are two-dimensional -- we have only `x` and `y`, there is no z coordinate
    - this suggests that our drunk cannot move "down" towards a "floor" or "up" to towards a "ceiling"

---
### Class Location (Full)
---

```python
class Location(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        """
        x and y are floats
        """
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def move(self, deltaX, deltaY):
        """
        deltaX and deltaY are floats
        """
        return Location(self.x + deltaX, self.y + deltaY)

    def getX(self):
        return self.x

    def getY(self):
        return self.y
    
    def distFrom(self, other):
        ox = other.x
        oy = other.y
        xDist = self.x - ox
        yDist = self.y - oy
        return (xDist**2 + yDist**2)**0.5

    def __str__(self):
        return '<' + str(self.x) + ', ' + str(self.y) + '>'
```

---
### Class Field, Part 1
---

```python
class Field(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.drunks = {}
    
    def addDrunk(self, drunk, loc):
        if drunk in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate drunk')
        else:
            self.drunks[drunk] = loc
    
    def getLoc(self, drunk):
        if drunk not in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Drunk not in field')
        return self.drunks[drunk]
```
- the key design decision embodied in this implementation is to make the location of a drunk in a field an attribute of the field rather than an attribute of the drunk
    - this might allow you, like Professor Guttag in this case, to think more easily about how drunks might relate to one another spatially
        - for example, could two drunks occupy the same location in the field simultaneously?
        - what we end up doing is thinking of `Field` as a mapping, drunks to locations, leading to the use of a dict as representation of our field (initially empty)
    - this does, however, put a constraint on how we can implement the drunk class
        - since we're using drunks as keys in a dict, the type drunk will have to be **hashable**
    - even though we think of each of these classes as a separate abstraction, we often have to think about *more than one at a time* during the design process

---
### Class Field (Full)
---

```python
class Field(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.drunks = {}
    
    def addDrunk(self, drunk, loc):
        if drunk in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate drunk')
        else:
            self.drunks[drunk] = loc
    
    def getLoc(self, drunk):
        if drunk not in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Drunk not in field')
        return self.drunks[drunk]

    def moveDrunk(self, drunk):
        if drunk not in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Drunk not in field')
        xDist, yDist = drunk.takeStep()
        currentLocation = self.drunks[drunk]

        # use move method of Location to get new location
        self.drunks[drunk] = currentLocation.move(xDist, yDist)
```
- first, check whether drunk is in field
    - because a field is a dict, it's reasonably efficient to check if a drunk is already in the set of keys, so it's a precaution we very well should take
- as we'll see, `drunk.takeStep` simply returns a pair of numbers indicating how far the drunk has moved in each of the `x` and `y` directions, `deltaX` and `deltaY`
- finally, we use those distances to move the location in the field to which the drunk is mapped

---
### Notable Aspects Of Class Field
---

- a mapping of drunks to locations
- unbounded size
    - drunk can get arbitrarily far away
- we allow multiple drunks with no constraints about how they relate to one another
    - for example, two drunks could occupy the same location

---
### Class Drunk
---

```python
class Drunk(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def __str__(self):
        return 'This drunk is named ' + self.name
```
- not very exciting, eh?
- well, it's not supposed to be, as it's **not intended to be used on its own**
    - it's a **base class** to be **inherited**
    - we'll use this base class to create two subclasses

---
### Two Subclasses Of Drunk
---

- the "usual" drunk, who wanders around at random
- the "I hate winter" drunk, who tries to move southward

---
### Two Kinds Of Drunks
---

```python
import random

class UsualDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        stepChoices = \
            [(0.0,1.0), (0.0,-1.0), (1.0,0.0), (-1.0,0.0)]
        return random.choice(stepChoices)

class ColdDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        stepChoices = \
            [(0.0,0.9), (0.0,-1.1), (1.0,0.0), (-1.0,0.0)]
        return random.choice(stepChoices)
```
- the `ColdDrunk` also chooses among four directions, again, each with equal probability
    - but notice that when he heads northward, he moves slightly less than one unit *and* when he moves southward, he moves slightly more than one unit
        - think of this as a **biased walk**
            - in the next segment, we will see the implication of this bias when we compare the possible and average trajectories of these two kinds of drunks

---

## 2.11 Simulating A Walk

---
### Simulating A Single Walk
---

```python
def walk(f, d, numSteps):
    """
    Assumes: f a Field, d a Drunk in f, and numSteps an int >= 0

    Moves d numSteps times; returns the distance between the final location and the location of the start of the walk
    """
    start = f.getLoc(d)
    for s in range(numSteps):
        f.moveDrunk(d)
    return start.distFrom(f.getLoc(d))
```
- because we took the time to find some **useful data abstractions**, building the simulation is easy and more obviously correct

---
### Simulating Multiple Walks
---

```python
# BUGGED CODE
def simWalks(numSteps, numTrials, dClass):
    """
    Assumes numSteps an int >= 0, numTrials an int > 0, dClass a subclass of Drunk

    Simulates numTrials walks of numSteps steps each
    Returns a list of the final distances for each trial
    """
    Homer = dClass()
    origin = Location(0,0)
    distances = []
    for t in range(numTrials):
        f = Field()
        f.addDrunk(Homer, origin)
        distances.append(round(walk(f, Homer, numTrials), 1))
    
    return distances
```
- the interesting bit here is that `simWalks` has an argument, `dClass` of type `class`
    - we do that so we can use the same code to simulate walks of as many different kinds of drunks as we care to create
        - notice that we do insist that `dClass` is a subclass of `class Drunk`

- so we create a `Drunk` of type `dClass`, call him `Homer`
- we set the origin to be 0, the `distances` to be the empty list
- then for `t` in `range(numTrials)`, we do a walk, save the `distances` to the append, and return the `distances`

---
### Putting It All Together
---

```python
def drunkTest(walkLengths, numTrials, dClass):
    """
    Assumes walkLengths a sequence of ints >= 0, numTrials an int > 0, dClass a subclass of Drunk

    For each number of steps in walkLengths, runs simWalks with numTrials walks and prints results
    """
    for numSteps in walkLengths:
        distances = simWalks(numSteps, numTrials, dClass)
        print(dClass.__name__, 'random walk of', numSteps, 'steps')
        print(' Means = ', round(sum(distances)/len(distances), 4))
        print(' Max = ', max(distances), 'Min =', min(distances))

random.seed(0)
drunkTest((10, 100, 1000, 10000), 100, UsualDrunk)
# OUTPUTS:
# UsualDrunk random walk of 10 steps
#  Mean = 8.634
#  Max = 21.6 Min = 1.4
# UsualDrunk random walk of 100 steps
#  Mean = 8.57
#  Max = 22.0 Min = 0.0
# UsualDrunk random walk of 1000 steps
#  Mean = 9.206
#  Max = 21.6 Min = 1.4
# UsualDrunk random walk of 10000 steps
#  Mean = 8.727
#  Max = 23.5 Min = 1.4
```
- if we look at these results, it appears that the final distance to the origin is pretty much independent of the number of steps
    - that means, the maximums, the minimums, don't seem to vary with the length of the walk beyond a small statistical variation
        - this isn't what we expected from our hand simulation -- we expected it to grow with the length, but it isn't

- it's possible to screw up any experiment, and simulations are no exception
    - before jumping to any conclusions, we should probably convince ourselves that the simulation results should be trusted; after all, anyone who's ever written a program knows it's possible to produce code with one or more bugs in it
- first thing we must do, then, is run the program on a simple example where we know what it is supposed to do (sanity check)

---
### Sanity Check
---

```python
drunkTest((0, 1, 2), 100, UsualDrunk)
# OUTPUTS:
# UsualDrunk random walk of 0 steps
#  Mean = 8.634
#  Max = 21.6 Min = 1.4
# UsualDrunk random walk of 1 steps
#  Mean = 8.57
#  Max = 22.0 Min = 0.0
# UsualDrunk random walk of 2 steps
#  Mean = 9.206
#  Max = 21.6 Min = 1.4
```
- so, it seems our code is kind of bogus
- indeed, our call to `walk` in `simWalks` puts `numTrials` where `numSteps` goes in arguments:

```python
# CORRECT VERSION OF BUGGED CODE ABOVE
def simWalks(numSteps, numTrials, dClass):
    """
    Assumes numSteps an int >= 0, numTrials an int > 0, dClass a subclass of Drunk

    Simulates numTrials walks of numSteps steps each
    Returns a list of the final distances for each trial
    """
    Homer = dClass()
    origin = Location(0,0)
    distances = []
    for t in range(numTrials):
        f = Field()
        f.addDrunk(Homer, origin)
        distances.append(round(walk(f, Homer, numSteps), 1))
    
    return distances
```

- now, if we run our original test suite:

```python
drunkTest((10, 100, 1000, 10000), 100, UsualDrunk)
# OUTPUTS:
# UsualDrunk random walk of 10 steps
#  Mean = 2.863
#  Max = 7.2 Min = 0.0
# UsualDrunk random walk of 100 steps
#  Mean = 26.812
#  Max = 66.3 Min = 4.2
# UsualDrunk random walk of 1000 steps
#  Mean = 30.873
#  Max = 71.8 Min = 1.4
# UsualDrunk random walk of 10000 steps
#  Mean = 88.991
#  Max = 226.5 Min = 10.0
```
- these results are a lot better, eh?
- we see that, in fact, the mean distance grows with the number of steps
    - doesn't mean it's right, but at least it looks much more plausible than we had before

---
### And The Heat-Seeking Drunk?
---

```python
class ColdDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        stepChoices = [(0.0,0.9), (0.0,-1.1), (1.0,0.0), (-1.0,0.0)]
        return random.choice(stepChoices)

def simAll(drunkKinds, walkLengths, numTrials):
    for dClass in drunkKinds:
        drunkTest(walkLengths, numTrials, dClass)

random.seed(0)
simAll((UsualDrunk, ColdDrunk), (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000), 100)
```
- `simAll` is probably a bit overkill when it comes to comparing only two classes of drunks, but this is modular code now that could easily handle many different classes of drunks if we wanted
    - its first arg is a tuple of classes of drunks
    - it then runs `drunkTest` for each class

- the `ColdDrunk` does indeed move away from origin faster than the `UsualDrunk`

- indeed, and unsruprisingly, something is happening; the two classes behave differently
    - but this printout is not a very convenient way to visualize what's actually happening
        - in the next segment, we'll look at plotting to visualize how the drunks are actually moving and to understand why we see this difference in total distance

---

## 2.12 Random Walks

---
### Iterating Over Styles
---

```python
class styleIterator(object):
    def __init__(self, styles):
        self.index = 0
        self.styles = styles

    def nextStyle(self):
        result = self.styles[self.index]
        if self.index == len(self.styles) - 1:
            self.index = 0
        else:
            self.index = self.index + 1
        return result
```
- since we're showing a number of different kinds of drunks from the same plot, we will associate a distinct presentation style with each type of drunk so it will be easy to visually differentiate among them

- the style will have three aspects:
    1. color of the line and the marker
    2. shape of the marker
    3. kind of line (e.g., solid or dotted)

---
### `simDrunk`
---

```python
def simDrunk(numTrials, dClass, walkLengths):
    meanDistances = []
    for numSteps in walkLengths:
        print('Starting simulation of', numSteps, 'steps')

        trials = simWalks(numSteps, numTrials, dClass)
        mean = sum(trials)/len(trials)
        meanDistances.append(mean)
    return meanDistances
```

---
### `simAll` (New Version)
---

```python
def simAll(drunkKinds, walkLengths, numTrials):
    styleChoice = styleIterator(('m-', 'b--', 'g-.'))
    for dClass in drunkKinds:
        curStyle = styleChoice.nextStyle()
        print('Starting simulation of', dClass.__name__)
        means = simDrunk(numTrials, dClass, walkLengths)

        pylab.plot(walkLengths, means, curStyle, label=dClass.__name__)
    pylab.title('Mean Distance from Origin (' + str(numTrials) + ' trials)')
    pylab.xlabel('Number of Steps')
    pylab.ylabel('Distance from Origin')
    pylab.legend(loc = 'best')

numSteps = (10, 100, 1000, 10000)
simAll((UsualDrunk, ColdDrunk), numSteps, 100)
```

---
### Getting Ends Of Multiple Walks
---

```python
def getFinalLocs(numSteps, numTrials, dClass):
    locs = []
    d = dClass()
    for t in range(numTrials):
        f = Field()
        f.addDrunk(d, Location(0, 0))
        for s in range(numSteps):
            f.moveDrunk(d)
        locs.append(f.getLoc(d))
    return locs
```

---
### Plotting Ending Locations
---

```python
def plotLocs(drunkKinds, numSteps, numTrials):
    styleChoice = styleIterator(('k+', 'r^', 'mo'))
    for dClass in drunkKinds:
        locs = getFinalLocs(numSteps, numTrials, dClass)
        xVals, yVals = [], []
        for loc in locs:
            xVals.append(loc.getX())
            yVals.append(loc.getY())
        xVals = pylab.array(xVals)
        yVals = pylab.array(yVals)
        meanX = sum(abs(xVals))/len(xVals)
        meanY = sum(abs(yVals))/len(yVals)
        curStyle = styleChoice.nextStyle()
        pylab.plot(xVals, yVals, curStyle, label=dClass.__name__ + ' mean abs distance = <' + str(meanX) + ', ' + str(meanY) + '>')
    pylab.title('Location at End of Walks (' + str(numSteps) + ' steps)')
    pylab.ylim(-1000,1000)
    pylab.xlim(-1000, 1000)
    pylab.xlabel('Steps East/West of Origin')
    pylab.ylabel('Steps North/South of Origin')
    pylab.legend(loc='upper left')

random.seed(0)
plotLocs((UsualDrunk, ColdDrunk), 10000, 1000)
```

---
### Fields With Wormholes
---

A wormhole, or Einstein-Rosen Bridge, is a hypothetical topological feature that's a shortcut connecting two separate points in space-time.  

---
### A Subclass Of `Field` (Part 1)
---

```python
class OddField(Field):
    def __init__(self, numHoles=1000, xRange=100, yRange=100):
        Field.__init__(self)
        self.wormholes = {}
        for w in range(numHoles):
            x = random.randint(-xRange, xRange)
            y = random.randint(-yRange, yRange)
            newX = random.randint(-xRange, xRange)
            newY = random.randint(-yRange, yRange)
            newLoc = Location(newX, newY)
            self.wormholes[(x,y)] = newLoc

    def moveDrunk(self, drunk):
        Field.moveDrunk(self, drunk)
        x = self.drunks[drunk].getX()
        y = self.drunks[drunk].getY()
        if (x, y) in self.wormholes:
            self.drunks[drunk] = self.wormholes[(x, y)]
```

### Tracing A Walk
---

// TODO

---
### Summary
---

- point is not the simulations themselves, but the process of building them
- three classes corresponding to domain-specific types
    - Location
    - Field
    - Drunk
- functions corresponding to:
    - one trial
    - multiple trials
    - result reporting
- created two subclasses of `Drunk`
- simulation had an argument of type class, so we could easily investigate both classes of `Drunk`
- made series of incremental changes to simulation so that we could investigate different questions
    - get simple version working first
    - elaborate a step at a time
- introduced a weird subclass of `Field`
    - easy to add to simulation
    - would have been hard to model analytically
